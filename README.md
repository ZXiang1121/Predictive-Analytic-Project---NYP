# Predictive-Analytic-Project---NYP

**Project Title**: Predictive Analytic Project<br/>
**Date Completed**: 23-08-2022<br/>
**Team Members**: Shermaine, Rawtbhik, Shi Min, Zhang Xiang<br/>

## Tasks
1. Collect data from multiple sources using appropriate collection tools and techniques that comply with data and privacy ethics.
2. Perform data pre-processing techniques to impute data, transform, reshape and protect the data in accordance with the business requirements and data protection principles.
3. Apply relevant predictive modelling techniques to predict the desired business outcomes to meet the service expectation of the key stakeholders.
4. Work collaboratively in a team to develop dashboards using data storytelling approach for an effective narrative and visual representation of their predictive analytics project.

## Project Scope & Scenario
Predictive analytics plays an important role in helping organizations make critical business decisions based on insights and information derived from collected data. Today, given some conditions, businesses want to know what is mostly likely to happen and identify actions that maximizes desirable outcomes. This is taking place across multiple industries, for example, healthcare, manufacturing, finance, retail, marketing manufacturing, human resources, cyber security and education.

In this project, you are to develop a predictive analytics model using the skills you have acquired in the other units:
- data collection/wrangling to develop effective data storytelling visualization and dashboards.
- Predictive models using supervised and/or unsupervised learning techniques.
- Protection of data privacy.
