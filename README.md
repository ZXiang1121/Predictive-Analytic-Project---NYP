# Predictive-Analytic-Project---NYP

**Project Title**: Predictive Analytic Project<br/>
**Date Completed**: 23-08-2022<br/>
**Team Members**: Shermaine, Rawtbhik, Shi Min, Zhang Xiang<br/>

## Tasks
1. Collect data from multiple sources using appropriate collection tools and techniques that comply with data and privacy ethics.
2. Perform data pre-processing techniques to impute data, transform, reshape and protect the data in accordance with the business requirements and data protection principles.
3. Apply relevant predictive modelling techniques to predict the desired business outcomes to meet the service expectation of the key stakeholders.
4. Work collaboratively in a team to develop dashboards using data storytelling approach for an effective narrative and visual representation of their predictive analytics project.

## Project Scope & Scenario
Predictive analytics plays an important role in helping organizations make critical business decisions based on insights and information derived from collected data. Today, given some conditions, businesses want to know what is mostly likely to happen and identify actions that maximizes desirable outcomes. This is taking place across multiple industries, for example, healthcare, manufacturing, finance, retail, marketing manufacturing, human resources, cyber security and education.

In this project, you are to develop a predictive analytics model using the skills you have acquired in the other units:
- data collection/wrangling to develop effective data storytelling visualization and dashboards.
- Predictive models using supervised and/or unsupervised learning techniques.
- Protection of data privacy.

## Business Objectives
In the present situation, our main objective is to propose a project to develop categorical predictive models of 85% accuracy to detect common health problems in our global population and the factors contributing to those health issues. As health problems are on the rise, our team believes that early detection and response are essential and a vital part of providing healthcare services with accuracy and effectiveness. Additionally, these predictions will help pinpoint factors associated with major health problems, so that potential patients will be aware of them and take preventive measures to avoid becoming victims of such problems. 

Due to a shortage of healthcare professionals, it will also be difficult to provide high-quality and accurate care to every patient. Hence, we are confident that our machine learning techniques will be able to detect health problems more accurately through algorithms and computer analysis, thereby reducing healthcare stress, delayed detection and human error.

## Empathy
**Engage** - During our interviews with the two doctors mentioned above, we found that strokes and diabetes are on the rise, requiring prompt and accurate detection.

**Observe** - Looking at our current healthcare conditions, especially with infectious diseases on the rise, we see that the healthcare industry is severely understaffed, so they will need help detecting common health problems to reduce their workload, checking and recommending each patient.
